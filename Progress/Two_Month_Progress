For 'staalmeesters' there are 4 compulsory excersises (a,b,c,d). We have 7 weeks to complete these with various algorithms.
Week 1: this week consisted of brainstorming and setting up a repository in Github.
Week 2: trying to at least fit each rectangle from order 1 into a sheet of steel. Start with our first algorithm for excersise a. 
Week 3: finish the first algorithm for excersise a and complete a second algorithm.
Week 4: tweak these algorithms for excersise b and start with excersise c.
Week 5: complete c and search for literature on triangle packing.
Week 6: start with excersise d.
Week 7: complete d if finished earlier than expected try excersise e. 
Week 8: improve written code and practise presentation. Give presentation.
