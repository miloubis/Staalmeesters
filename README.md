# Staalmeesters

## The problem
In this repository you can find different algorithms that try to solve a two-dimensional strip packing problem. In a
two-dimensional packing problem there is a given width and the objective is to pack a set of rectangles within a 
minimum length. The Staalmeesters is a problem whereby we (the steel cutting company) get orders from clients with
sets of rectangles, varying in length and width. The steel supplier sells three different widhts of steel rolls 
with different prices. We have to cut the orders from the clients in a way that minimizes the lenght of used steelroll and
thus minimizes the cost.

## Algorithm usage
The algorithms can be used in the following manner ...
