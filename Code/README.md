## Code
This directory contains the scripts necessary to run the test and to see which algorithm works the best for an order. Here you'll find the main scripts for each algorithm and the supporting files. Load_orders is a file mainly consisting of an list of lists in which all orders are stored. Each order can also be summoned using the load_orders file. In classes information about each order can be stored. And lastly helper is a file that contains every function used in the algorithms. Reading through the scripts indicates how each algorithm can be tweaked or used for a certain order. The default setting for each algorithm is order 1 as order and sort_long as sorting method. Test files that are currently used are also stored in this map but removed once no longer usedful.

**Reminders**

The first number of an order for a rectangle is height, the second number is width. This means 210x300 is height(210)xwidth(300). In a 2d array the height is represented with rows and the width is represented with columns.

### Usage
You can run each exercise (a/b/c) in each algorithm by uncommenting the exercise you would like to run.
